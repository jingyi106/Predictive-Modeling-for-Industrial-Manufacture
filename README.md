Applying Machine Learning to improve the manufacturing yield rate

This repository contains my capstone project in UESTC. 

This project aims at researching on machine learning theory applied for data mining in the industry production line, especially for the complex data analysis of industrial field production process in discrete manufacturing industry.

Machine learning algorithms are used to do dichotomy for these products (whether they are pass or fail) based on their mass data in the production line.

Due to the data privacy requirements of cooperated enterprise, the code and datasets are not public and all the contents in this report is a version after desensitization treatment
